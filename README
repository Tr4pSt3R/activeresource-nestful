= activeresource-nestful

Nestful extension to ActiveResource, basically replacing ActiveResource's net/http
connection with Nestful. This gives you a few really useful things:
* OAuth support
* Multipart uploads

Usage:

  require "active_resource/nestful"

  class Post < ActiveResource::Nestful::Base
  end

See the examples folder for more usage cases.
